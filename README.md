# E-commerce site
An e-commerce app where users can buy/sell products. To buy, a user adds items to his/her cart, pays online, and views his/her invoices. To sell a product, s/he adds its title, image, price, and short description.

# Design
 - The web application is built with MVC architecture.
 - It relies on Express to navigate between views and handle dynamic routes, EJS as a templating language to render views' dynamic content, Mongoose ODM to access MongoDB, and stripe for online payment.
 - The app provides sessions, authentication, and server-side validations for users. It is protected from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and routes are protected from access by unauthorized users. Encrypted passwords are stored in database.
 - The app sends a mail to its user to confirm his/her signup or to reset his/her password.
 - Products are displayed in the shop via a responsive pagination and deleted by users through asynchronous requests and DOM manipulation.
 - Invoices for users' orders are generated by PDFKit library.



## Run on local machine

- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:pesen11/git@github.com:pesen11/E-commerce.git

```




- For MongoDB access, replace <username> and <password> in app.js with yours:


```bash
  const MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0-rbjdo.mongodb.net/shop';

```

- For stripe's payment, replace both test API keys: publishable key in views/shop/checkout.ejs at line 24 and secret key in controllers/shop.js at line 8.
- Replace SendGrid's API key in controllers/auth.js at line 13.
- Navigate to the app's root directory at the terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
    npm install bcryptjs body-parser connect-flash connect-mongodb-session csurf ejs express express-session
        express-validator mongodb mongoose multer nodemailer nodemailer-sendgrid-transport pdfkit stripe
    node app.js
```

In your browser go to localhost:3000
